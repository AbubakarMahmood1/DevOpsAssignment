# Todo Platform Integration Guide

This document describes how the various components of our Todo Platform work together to form a cohesive Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

## Platform Components

### 1. Developer Portal (Backstage)

Our Backstage portal serves as the single entry point for developers to discover and interact with platform components:

- **Software Catalog**: Maintains inventory of all microservices, APIs, and resources
- **Documentation**: Centralized technical documentation (via TechDocs)
- **Service Templates**: Standardized templates for creating new services

### 2. GitOps with Argo CD

Our GitOps workflow ensures that the state of our system is always as declared in our Git repository:

1. Developers commit changes to the Git repository
2. CI pipeline runs tests and builds container images
3. Argo CD detects changes and applies them to the cluster
4. Deployment status is reported back to developers

### 3. Policy Enforcement (OPA/Gatekeeper)

Policies ensure that all deployed resources adhere to organizational standards:

- Resource limits/requests are always specified
- Required labels are applied to all resources
- Security best practices are enforced

### 4. Observability Stack

The observability stack provides insights into application and infrastructure health:

- **Metrics**: Prometheus collects and stores metrics
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards visualize performance data
- **Tracing**: Jaeger provides distributed tracing capabilities
- **Logging**: Logs are collected and searchable

## Developer Workflow

1. **Service Creation**:
   - Developer uses Backstage to create a new service from a template
   - Template generates scaffolding with best practices and integrations

2. **Local Development**:
   - Developer uses Docker Compose to run the service locally
   - OpenTelemetry SDK is included by default for observability

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Developer commits code to GitHub
   - GitHub Actions runs tests, linting, and builds container images

4. **Deployment**:
   - Argo CD automatically deploys the changes to the appropriate environment
   - Gatekeeper validates that the resources conform to policies

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Developer monitors service health and performance through Grafana dashboards
   - Traces are available in Jaeger for debugging
