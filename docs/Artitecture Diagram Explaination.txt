Main Components:
1. AWS Cloud & VPC

What it is: The cloud environment where everything runs
Purpose: Provides infrastructure for all our services

2. EKS Cluster

What it is: Kubernetes cluster managed by AWS
Purpose: Orchestrates all our containers and services

3. Namespaces (The colored boxes)

Monitoring Namespace (Yellow box)

Contains: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry Collector
Purpose: Observes and monitors everything


Platform Namespace (Blue box)

Contains: Backstage, ArgoCD, OPA/Gatekeeper
Purpose: Provides tools for developers and enforces policies


Production/Development Namespaces (Green/Red boxes)

Contains: Frontend, Backend, MongoDB
Purpose: Runs the actual application in different environments



4. Service Mesh (Gray bar)

What it is: Istio service mesh
Purpose: Manages traffic between services and provides security

Information Flow:
1. Developer Workflow

Developers work on code â†’ Push to GitHub
GitHub Actions runs tests and builds images
ArgoCD detects changes and deploys to the cluster
Gatekeeper checks if deployments follow policies

2. Observability Flow

Application components send telemetry data to OpenTelemetry Collector
Collector forwards:

Metrics to Prometheus
Traces to Jaeger


Prometheus data is visualized in Grafana dashboards

3. User Access Flow

Users access the application through AWS Load Balancer
Load Balancer routes to Istio Gateway
Istio routes traffic to appropriate services
Backend services interact with MongoDB

4. Platform Management Flow

Developers use Backstage to discover services and APIs
ArgoCD ensures deployed state matches Git repository
Gatekeeper enforces policies on all resources
All components report metrics for monitoring

Key Integrations:

ArgoCD + Git = Ensures deployments match repository state
Backstage + Services = Provides service catalog and documentation
OpenTelemetry + Apps = Collects metrics and traces from all services
Gatekeeper + Deployments = Enforces organizational standards
Istio + Services = Manages network traffic and security
